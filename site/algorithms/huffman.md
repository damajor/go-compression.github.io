# Huffman

Since it's creation by David A. Huffman in 1952, Huffman coding has been regarded as one of the most efficient and optimal methods of compression. Huffman's optimal compression ratios are made possible through it's character counting functionality. Unlike many algorithims in the Lempel-Ziv suite, Huffman encoders scan the file and generate a frequency table and tree before begining the true compression process. Before discussing different implementations, lets dive deeper into how the algorithim works.
