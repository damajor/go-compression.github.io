# Raisin

[Raisin](https://github.com/go-compression/raisin) is a compression project that myself, Phillip Cutter, and Arnav Chawla built under the guidance of our mentor, Skip Tavakkolian. This project spanned 6 weeks and encompasses our work in implementing various compression algorithms in Go along with an easy-to-use CLI interface. This website is the project encompassing our learning along our journey of researching and implementing lossless compression algorithms.

Most compression algorithm documents on this site should be implemented within this project in a performant manner, though if not, you should check the [examples repo](https://github.com/go-compression/examples).
